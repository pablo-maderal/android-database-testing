# Android-Database-Testing
This is a short project to display and hone junior developer skills.

I hope that this project can show my familiarity with
 * Java and Object Oriented Programming concepts
 * SQL data management and manipulation
 
Skills that I intend to develop and show improvement with updates:
  * Adherence to best practices and naming conventions
  * Clear, readable, and consistent code design and documentation
  * Ability to work with different coding frameworks in a singular project
  
  
  # Running the app
  
  For help setting and running the Spring Server, the reader can visit
  https://github.com/afsalashyana/Spring-boot-tutorial.
  
 My spring server is nearly identical.
 The differences are in the @RestController and the DAO (database access object) class.
 The current functionality of my project is simply to increment columns of a mySQL database table,
 and display the percentages each column makes up of the whole.

 The above link was very helpful in recognizing the different components that make up
 a spring server api. I still have a lot to learn! Dependency Injection is a little tough for me to wrap my head around, very cool tho!
